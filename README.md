# hello-world

This is my first github project! It contains the following source files:
```
hello.c:   A C code printing "Hello World"
hello1.cu: A CUDA code printing "Hello World" from the host
hello2.cu: A CUDA code printing "Hello World" from the device for one time
hello3.cu: A CUDA code printing "Hello World" from the device for multiple times
hello4.cu: A CUDA code printing "Hello World" from the device with block id and thread id
```

Can I write equations here?

$$ y = \int f(x) dx $$
